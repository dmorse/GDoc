# GDoc - Generic Documentation Utility

Author: David Morse

Copyright (2002) Regents of the University of Minnesota

GDoc is a python script that can be used to extract multi-line 
documentation strings from programs written in a variety of languages, 
and output them as formatted documentation. The script is designed to 
generate software documentation, but is largely independent of the 
language in which the software is written. The utility works by 
extracting comment lines that begin with a special character, which 
can set by the user to allow compatibility with the syntax of different 
languages. Blocks of documentation that are intended to be extracted by 
GDoc is also marked by special strings of characters in the first and 
last lines of the block. GDoc was developed to facilitate documentation 
of the PSCF fortran program, located at https://github.com/dmorse/pscf.

The source files for GDoc are themselves documented using the GDoc
format, so that GDoc can generate its own documentation. A set of html 
files that were generated by applying GDoc to itself are available in 
the docs/ directory of this repository, and are accessible online at 
https://dmorse.github.io/GDoc/toc.html.
